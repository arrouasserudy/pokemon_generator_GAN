I try to generate new pokemons using a relatively small dataset (455 images of existing pokemons)
using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN).

Examples from dataset:
![Alt real_pokemon](images/real/real1.png?raw=false "pokemon")
![Alt real_pokemon](images/real/real2.png?raw=true "pokemon")
![Alt real_pokemon](images/real/real3.png?raw=true "pokemon")

I began from a random noise and this is the result after 10 epochs:
![Alt real_pokemon](images/fake/fake_samples_epoch_009.png?raw=true "fake")
